<h3> About </h3>
<p>Sunheri Mahal derives its name from the gold paintings that were hung in the palace.
This palace is an eminent historical site in Aurangabad. It was built by a Bandalkand leader who travelled along Aurangzeb to Southern India.
The monument is made up of lime and stone and was positioned on towering pillars. However the high pillars have tumbledowned with time.
The palace-cum-museum is located on the premises of Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University.</p>
