<marquee> <h1> WELCOME TO AURANGABAD </h1> </marquee>
<div>
<h3>The name is derived from the Mughal ruler, Aurangazeb.
Its ancient history dates back up to the eras of Buddhism, but the modern history of Aurangabad is traced back to 1610.
The Buddhist caves in Aurangabad and Ellora are the clear evidence of strong Buddhism influence and influx around the city in earlier times.</h3>
<h3>It is the administrative headquarters of Aurangabad district and is the largest city in the Marathwada region.Located on a hilly upland terrain in the Deccan Traps, Aurangabad is the fourth-most populous urban area in Maharashtra with a population of 1,175,116.
The city is known as a major production center of cotton textile and artistic silk fabrics. Several prominent educational institutions, including Dr. Babasaheb Ambedkar Marathwada University, are located in the city.
Aurangabad, which was declared by the Government as the Tourism Capital of Maharashtra back in 2010, is a famous tourist hub which greets its visitors with a richly woven tapestry of sights and sounds.
The city got its name for being the erstwhile capital of Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb in the 17th century AD.</h3>
