<h3> ABOUT </h3>
<p>Daulatabad Fort is a 14th century fort situated in Maharashtra.
The fort is located in Devagiri, on a hill about 200 meters high.
The fort is truly a site to behold. The only means of access to the fort is through the summit of the hill, by a narrow bridge.
There is also a long gallery with steep steps to the fort. The features of the fort are very calculatively designed in order to avoid any external intrusion.
There is only one entry and exit in order to confuse the enemy searching for an exit from the fort.
Moreover, there are no parallel gates, in order to break the momentum of the enemy clan.
The spikes on the gates insured that there were no unwelcomed guests within the premises of the fort.
The curved walls, false doors and complex entrances were another way to make the enemy lose his way in the maze of the fort, in case he managed to enter uninvited.
Another interesting fact about the site is that it is shaped in the form of a tortoise back.
This also worked to the advantage of the fort and its occupants as the weird shape did not allow mountain lizards to climb up the fort.</p>
